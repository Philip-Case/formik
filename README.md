Formik React App 
What Is It?
My REACT App uses the Formik libraries to display and validate a user input form.  The form includes the following fields:

Username
Password
Email

A submit button and handler notify user if hypothetical log-in was successful.


Initial Challenges:
Ensuring folder architecture and library install
Email Validation

Ideas for Future Improvements:
Improve form field layout, spacing, and stylce
Add password requirements that include more security
